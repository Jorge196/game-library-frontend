# Installation
```
    After forking and cloning the Repo of both the frontend and the backend, you must run ``bundle install`` in the terminal.
``` 

# Using the App
    ```
    In order to successfully start the application, you must first run `rails s` 
    in the console of the backend directory. On the frontend directory, you run `explorer.exe index.html` and the app should appear in your browser. The application will then prompt you to login to the application with just your name. The app will show all the games where the user will be able to see the games and interact with the application by creating reviews for each of those games.

    ```
